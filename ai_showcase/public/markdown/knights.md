This program is a logic-based puzzle solver that utilizes knowledge bases and propositional logic to deduce the truth values of symbols representing the roles of different characters. Knowledge bases are a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence, representing a collection of statements that an agent knows to be true. In this program, we use knowledge bases to encode information about the characters and their statements as logical expressions.

The program represents each character's role (Knight or Knave) using propositional symbols, such as AKnight and AKnave for character A. These symbols are then combined using logical connectives (such as And, Or, and Not) to form complex logical expressions. The knowledge base for each puzzle is built by encoding the rules of the game, the statements made by the characters, and any additional information provided.

For example, in Puzzle 1, the following knowledge base is constructed:

```python
knowledge1 = And(
Or(AKnight, AKnave),
Not(And(AKnight, AKnave)),
Or(BKnight, BKnave),
Not(And(BKnight, BKnave)),

Implication(AKnight, Astatement),
Implication(AKnave, Not(Astatement))
)
```

In this knowledge base, we first encode the general rule that a character can either be a Knight or a Knave, but not both (e.g., `Or(AKnight, AKnave)` and `Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))`). Then, we encode the implications of the characters' statements, such as `Implication(AKnight, Astatement)` which states that if A is a Knight, then A's statement must be true. Conversely, `Implication(AKnave, Not(Astatement))` states that if A is a Knave, then A's statement must be false.

Once the knowledge base is constructed, the program uses a model-checking algorithm to deduce the truth values of the propositional symbols, effectively solving the puzzle.

The combination of knowledge bases and logical expressions allows for the representation and manipulation of complex information, making it possible for the program to solve these logic puzzles systematically.
